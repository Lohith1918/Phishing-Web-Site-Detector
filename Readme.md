Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to detect phishing websites in real-time by analyzing their URLs. It provides a proactive solution to help users and cybersecurity professionals identify threats before any data is compromised. ðŸŽ£

ðŸ“œ Description
Phishing is a deceptive technique that manipulates users into divulging confidential information by mimicking trusted websites. With the rapid expansion of internet usage, phishing attacks have become more sophisticated and harder to detect using conventional techniques like blacklists or manually curated rules.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system that can detect phishing websites by analyzing URLs. The system extracts several key features from the URLâ€”such as the presence of IP addresses, suspicious characters, subdomain usage, and SSL certificate detailsâ€”which are then used to train a classification model capable of predicting the legitimacy of the website.

The proposed system is implemented using Python, and the trained model is deployed through a web-based interface, allowing users to input URLs and receive immediate feedback on their safety.

âœ¨ Key Features
URL Feature Extraction: Analyzes various components of a URL, including:

Presence of IP addresses

Suspicious characters (e.g., '@', '-')

Number and length of subdomains

SSL certificate validity

Machine Learning Model: Employs a classification model trained on the extracted features to predict if a website is a phishing attempt.

Real-Time Detection: Provides immediate feedback on the safety of a URL through a simple web interface.

Proactive Security: Helps identify threats before users can be harmed, enhancing overall digital security.
